### üîç Highlights

- **Frequency Configurations Shape Synchronization**  
  Our analysis reveals how frequency configurations govern synchronization patterns in duplex networks with frustrated interlayer connections.

- **Regular vs. Random Frequency Assignment**  
  We compare a *Regular* frequency assignment model with a *Random* one, maintaining the same average frequency differences between mirror nodes. The differing synchronization behaviors reveal that average frequency differences alone do not dictate dynamics.

- **Explosive Transitions with Double Hysteresis Loops**  
  The *Regular* model‚Äôs multimodal frequency distribution triggers abrupt phase transitions, characterized by double hysteresis loops in frustrated duplex networks.

- **Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Wave Patterns**  
  Under the *Regular* frequency assignment, the system exhibits complex, overlapping wave patterns with pronounced phase‚Äìamplitude coupling across frequency components.

- **Interlayer Frustration Controls Sync Order in Layers**  
  In duplex networks with *Regular* coupling, interlayer frustration alters the temporal synchronization hierarchy among components within each individual layer.


  ### üìÑ Abstract

This study explores the dynamics of two-layer multiplex networks, focusing on how frequency distributions among mirror nodes influence phase transitions and synchronization across layers. We present a *Regular* frequency assignment model for duplex networks, where the layers are fully connected and share identical sets of natural frequencies. By adjusting the sizes of sections where nodes exhibit positive, zero, or negative frequency differences relative to their mirrored equivalents in another layer, we can effectively control the average frequency discrepancy between the layers. 

We compared the dynamics of this structured model to those with randomly distributed frequencies, keeping a constant average frequency difference between the layers and introducing a phase lag in the interlayer interaction terms. This comparison highlighted distinct behaviors, including double hysteresis loops in the synchronization phase transition and standing waves for intralayer coupling at the locations of the hysteresis loops, where the waves are composed of different interacting frequencies.
